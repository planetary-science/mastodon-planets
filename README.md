# Planetary Science on Mastodon

This repository generates a web page with a list of Mastodon accounts that are tabulated in a simple CSV database. The purpose of this project is to allow someone to easily find planetary scientists that are on Mastodon, and to also provide a simple way to bulk follow those accounts that interest the user. This should be useful to new Mastodon users who are looking for people to follow, as well as experienced users who are searching for their colleagues.

To use, go to this <a href="https://planetary-science.github.io/mastodon-planets" target="_blank">website</a>, click on those accounts that interest you, and then at the bottom of the list, click on "Get CSV for selected accounts". This will download a CSV file that you can use in your Mastodon account to follow the accounts you selected. The list can be filtered by clicking on either a keyword or language: Clicking on the activated keyword or language again will undo the filter. To follow the accounts you selected, go to your Mastodon account profile, select "import and export", select "import", and then choose to merge the file you just created into your following list.

If you would like to appear in this list, please fill out <a href="https://framaforms.org/planetary-science-on-mastodon-1680362333" target="_blank">this form</a>. Please note that this is an opt-in list only. We will also verify that you are a planetary scientist, or post about planetary science, before we add your account to the list.
